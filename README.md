Goal: build a webpage to showcase projects during and after the MITxPro course.


This is version 1.0 of my working portfolio.

## Lessons Learned

- Don't underestimate the dedication needed to pull through a big project, especially a solo project
- Getting caught up in every detail kills schedules
- CSS likes specificity 
- Efficency is the ULTIMATE goal
- I definitely have a love/hate relationship with designing webpages...
- This portfolio will grow with my understanding of how best to create and organize my code
## Roadmap





- [ ]  Clean out code: the most impact with the least code
- [ ]  Use routing to allow for a much more efficient use of re-usable assets
- [ ]  Reconfigure with REACT
- [ ]  Add **much** more color and play with elements to move the eye through the page and eat up some of that white space
- [ ]  Convert the tabs to a more solid navbar
- [ ]  Add side projects
- [ ]  Dark mode/high contrast
