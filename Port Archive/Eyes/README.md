# EYES
<br />
Watch the cat eyes stalk the mouse (pun fully intended). Where you wave your mouse, the cat's eyes will follow.  
This is a more styled version of the original project. Couln't resist a good pun. <br/>
<br />
Updated version includes cat like eye shape, slit pupils, whiskers, and a triangular nose.
<br />
<br />
Known Issue: window resize skews top and bottom half of face away from each other.
